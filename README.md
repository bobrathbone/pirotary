Raspberry PI Rotary Swich classes

This tutorial has been designed to help students and constructors to understand how to use Rotary 
Encoders and to use them in their own Raspberry PI projects. The principle hardware required to 
build a project using Rotary Encoders consists of the following components:
• A Raspberry PI computer
• One or more rotary encoders with or without push button
• The rotary_class.py code and associated test programs.
